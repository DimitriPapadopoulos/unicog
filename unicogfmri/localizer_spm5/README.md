# TUTORIAL "Analysing Neurospin's localizer dataset with SPM5"

This tutorial briefly explains how to analyse the Pinel's standard localizer data with SPM5. 

As a reminder, the "localizer" consists of a 5 minutes experiment during which the participant sees various visual stimuli (checkboard, letter strings, ...), listens to spoken stimuli, performs some simple arithmetic computations, and presses response buttons. 

### Prerequisites

Data must be ready for first level analyses, i.e. they must be organized accordingly to the expected structure (see README.txt) and preprocessed.

## Preparation

You will have to adapt the parameters in file "main.m" and check that everything is correct in the other files (in particular onset values in "specif_model.m").

### First-level processing 
    
"main.m" is the file to be run in Matlab.
